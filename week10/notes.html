        <h3>Form Validation</h3>
        <p>When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.</p>
        <p>When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.</p>
        <p>There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Built-in form validation</strong> uses HTML5 form validation features. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Using built-in form validation</strong></p>
        <p>Using validation attributes on form elements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.</li>
            <li>minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)<li>
            <li>min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</li>
            <li>type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.</li>
            <li>pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>


<p>If the data entered in a form field follows all of the rules specified by the above attributes, it is considered valid. If not, it is considered invalid.</p>
<p>When an element is valid, the following things are true:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements.</li>
    <li>If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so.</li>
</ul>

<p>When an element is invalid, the following things are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>The element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other UI pseudo-classes (e.g., :out-of-range) depending on the error, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements.</li>
<li>If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form and display an error message.</li>
</ul>

<p>Validating against a regular expression</p>
<p>Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value. A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text strings, so regexps are ideal for form validation and serve a variety of other uses in JavaScript.
</p>

<p>Validating forms using JavaScript</p>
    <p>You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation. In this section we will look at the different ways to do this.</p>

<p>The Constraint Validation API</p>
<p>Most browsers support the Constraint Validation API, which consists of a set of methods and properties available on the following form element DOM interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTMLButtonElement (represents a button element)</li>
<li>HTMLFieldSetElement (represents a fieldset element)</li>
<li>HTMLInputElement (represents an input element)</li>
<li>HTMLOutputElement (represents an output element)</li>
<li>HTMLSelectElement (represents a select element)</li>
<li>HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a textarea element)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fetch</h3>
<p>

    The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
    
    This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest. Fetch provides a better alternative that can be easily used by other technologies such as Service Workers. Fetch also provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to HTTP.</p>
    <p>The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings. To cause browsers to send a request with credentials included on both same-origin and cross-origin calls, add credentials: 'include' to the init object you pass to the fetch() method. If you only want to send credentials if the request URL is on the same origin as the calling script, add credentials: 'same-origin'. To instead ensure browsers don’t include credentials in the request, use credentials: 'omit'.</p>

    <p>A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side, although this usually means permission issues or similar — a 404 does not constitute a network error, for example. An accurate check for a successful fetch() would include checking that the promise resolved, then checking that the Response.ok property has a value of true.</p>
