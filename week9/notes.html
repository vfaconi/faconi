        <p>Every JavaScript environment has aglobal object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the <strong>window object,</strong> which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>
        <p><strong>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short)</strong> is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though,this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. These properties and methods are made available through the window object. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</p>
        <p>In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object; it’s less typing and your code will be more portable between environments. An exception is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined.</p>
        <p>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being used.</p>
        <p>The <strong>window.location</strong> property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</p>
        <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API.The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page.</p>
        <p>A new window can be opened using the <strong>window.open()</strong> method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code</p>
        <p>The <strong>window.screen</strong> object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties respectively.</p>
        <p>Each windowobject contains a <strong>document object.</strong> This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong> are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol.This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered. Cookies can be used to side step this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests. A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same domain that set them. To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s 'cookie jar', using the document.cookie property.Thedocument.cookieproperty acts like a special type of string. Assigning another cookie to it won’t overwrite the entire property, it will just append it to the end of the string. Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser session is finished (when the user closes the browser tab or window). Cookies can be made persistent ― that is, lasting beyond the browser session ―by adding "; expires=date" to the end of the cookie when it’s set, where date is a date value in the UTC String format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT</p>
        <p>The <strong>window.setTimeout()</strong> method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.</p>
        <p>The <strong>window.setInterval()</strong> method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</p>
        <p><strong>requestAnimationFrame -</strong> this method of the window object works in much the same way as the window.setInterval() method, although it has a number of improvements to optimize its performance. These include making the most of the browser’s built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not running the animation when the tab isinactive, resulting in a much smoother performance. It’s supported in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer from version 10 onwards.</p><br>

        
        <p><strong>HTML5</strong> is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to createweb pages.</p>
        <p>The data-attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so arenot intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particularelement on the page.</p>
        <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</p>
        <p>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
            <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same)</li>
            <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies.</li>
            <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a pop up once a day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, thewindowobject will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. The information is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings. There is also a sessionStorage object that works in the same way, although the data is only saved for the current session.</p>
        <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user’s location or speed and direction of travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.</p>
        <p>Web workers allow computationally complex operations to be performed in a separate thread, meaning that the flow of a program won’t suffer interruptions, and an application will not freeze or hang. They are a useful feature that help to keep sites responsive, even when complicated operations are being carried out.</p>
        <p>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests. This allows you to take alternative action if the network is offline, and effectively create app-like offline experiences. Service workers also allow access to push notifications and background syncing. Service workers require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code hijacking network requests.</p>
        <p></p>>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server –also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.To see this in action, we’ll create a mini-messaging application that uses the web socket protocol to communicate with an Echo server. This sends a response that is exactly the same as the message it receives.</p>
        <p>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system’s notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn’t the current tab. Before you can send notifications, you need to get permission granted by the user.This can be achieved using the request Permission() method of a Notification global object.</p>
        <p>Before HTML5, it was notoriously difficult to display audio and video inbrowsers, and plugins such as Flash often had to be used. HTML5 introduced the audio and video tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a webpage in real time using JavaScript. A canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate system that starts at (0,0) in the top-left corner.To add a canvas element to a page, the canvas tag is used specifying a height and width.</p>
