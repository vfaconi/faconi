        <h2>Week 04 - My notes</h2>
        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>It’s possible, and becoming more and more common, to process the information in a form on the front end before it is sent to the server using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Thea ction attribute is the URL that the form will be submitted to so it can be processed on the server side</p>
        <p><strong>Accessinf Form Elements</strong> - The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup</p>
        <p>The <strong>form.submit()</strong> method will submit the form automatically. A form can be submitted manually by the user employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit, or even an input element with a type attribute of image.</p>
        <p>The <strong>form.reset()</strong> method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the need for additional scripting.</p>
        <p>The <strong>form.action property</strong> can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server.</p>
        <p><strong>Form Events</strong> The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an input element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element (either by clickingor tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard)</p>
        <p><strong>Submitting a Form</strong> Possibly the most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it’s sent by adding a submit event listener.</p>
        <p>Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.We can use this to report back what the user has searched for.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Form Controls</strong></li>
        <li>input fields - including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
        <li>select menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
        <li>textarea - elements for longer text entry</li>
        <li>button elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Text Input - The default type of input field istext, which is used for entering a short piece oftext, such as a username</p>
        <p>Password Input - input type='password'is used to enter passwords or secret information. Thisworks in the same way as an input field withtype='text', except the charactersare concealed as they are entered so they’re unable to be read on the screen</p>
        <p>Checkbox Input - Check boxes are created using input fields withtype='checkbox'. They are used to select different options that can be checked (true) or left unchecked (false). The user can select more than one checkbox from a list.</p>
        <p>Radio buttons input - are created using input fields withtype='radio'. Like checkboxesthey allow users to check an option astrue, but they provide an exclusive choiceof options, soonly one optioncan be selected</p>
        <p>Hidden Input - Hidden fields can be created using input fields withtype='hidden'. These arenot displayed by the browser, but have avalueattribute that can containinformation that is submitted with the form. They are often used to sendinformation such as settings or information that the user has already provided</p>
        <p>File input - A file input field can be created using input fields withtype='file'. These areused to upload files, and most browsers will provide a browse button or similarthat lets users select a file from their file system</p>
        <h3>OOP</h3>
        <p>Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects inthe real world.</p>
        <p><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user.</p>
        <p>Polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Inheritance:</strong> taking the features of one object then adding some new features. In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
        <p><strong>Prototype-based language</strong> using actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects.</p>
        <p>The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the classhas been declared. It should be used to define any properties that will remain thesame for every instance of the class.</p>
        <p>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the function</p>
        <p>The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks amethod, JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method. If not, itwill check that function’s prototype until it finds the method or reaches theObjectconstructor function</p>
        <p>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause  errors. This can be worked around by using that = this, using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.</p>
        <h3>Modern JS</h3>
        <p>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make iteasier to achieve common tasks.  A library will abstract functionality into easier-to-usefunctions and methods. These can then be used to complete common tasks without having to use lots of repetitive code</p>
        <p>The <strong>jQuery</strong> library uses the$symbol as a convenient alias for the the globaljQueryobject that contains all of jQuery’s methods. This prevents the global scopefrom being polluted with any of jQuery’s methods</p>
        <p>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methodsthat can then be used in other files and by other modules.</p>
        <p>Default exportsrefer toa single variable, function or class in a module that can beimported without having to be explicitly named.</p>
        <p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long timein server-side languages</p>
        <p>Package managers allow developers to download modulesfrom a central repository. A package is just a directory with one or more files of code, as well as a package.json file that contains information about the code in the package.</p>
        <p>npm allows you to install JavaScript packages onto your machine. Some packages rely on other packages, so npm acts as a dependency manager. For example, if you use npm to install a package, it will also install all the packages that the original package depends on as well.</p>
        <p>The npm init command is used when you start a project. It walks you through creating a package.jsonfile.</p>
        <p>When you install a package using npm it will become a dependency of your project by default. This will get listed under "dependencies" in the package.jsonfile as we saw in the example above. If a package is a dependency, it means the application requires it to run.</p>


        <!--Code-->
        <script>
        const month = function() {
        const names = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May",
                         "June", "July", "August", "September", "October",
                         "November", "December"];
            return {
              name: function(number) { return names[number]; },
              number: function(name) { return names.indexOf(name); }
            };
          }();
          console.log(month.name(5))
          console.log(month.number("May"))
        </script>
