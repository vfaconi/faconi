        <h2>Week 02 - My notes</h2>
        <p>Undefined, NaN and infinity are reserved words.</p>
        <p><strong>Primitive data types:</strong> string, symbol, number, boolean, undefined, null.
            Any value that isn't one of thr primitive data types above is an <strong>object</strong>. These includes arrays, functions and object literals.
        </p>
        <p>JS has a special operator called <strong>typeof</strong> for finding out tupe of a value.</p>
        <ul><strong>Variables:</strong>
        <li>const - when the variable will not reassigned to another value.</li>
        <li>let - if variable might be reassigned.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the variable references a non-primitive data type, such as an array, function or object, then using const will not make it immutable.</p>
        <p>Global Scope - any variable declared outside of a block. This means it is accessible everywhere in the program.
            Blocks can be used to create a local scope.
        </p>
        <p>Primitive data types and objects have properties and methods. Properties are information about the object or value, while methods perform an action on the object or value, either to change it or to tell us something about it.</p>
        <p>Symbols can be used to create unique values, which helps to avoid any naming collisions.</p>
        <ul>Array - is an ordered list of values.
        <li>Pop - remove the last item from an array.</li>
        <li>Shift - removes the firt item</li>
        <li>Push - appends a new value to the end of the array</li> 
        <li>Unshift - appends new item to the beginning</li>
        <li>Concat - used to merge an array with one or more arrays.</li>
        <li>Spreads - this can be used to spread the elements of two arrays and put them together in a new array</li>
    </ul>
        <ul>Function
            <li>Function declaration: function keyword and is followed by the name of thefunction</li>
            <li>Return Values - All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement,which comes after thereturnkeyword.</li>
            <li><strong>Parameters</strong> a function needs are set when the function is defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with <strong>arguments.</strong></li>
            <li>Arrow functions can be identified by the arrow symbol,=>that gives them theirname. The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the functioncomes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer tothem, you must assign them to a variable</li>
            <li>Functions can also be given as a parameter to another function</li>
        </ul>
