        <h2>Further Functions</h2>
        <p>The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and methods themselves</p>
        <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.</p>
        <p>A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or <strong>memoization</strong>. If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return thevalue from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again.</p>
        <p>An <strong>Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE (pronounced “iffy”)</strong> – is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’sdefined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function).</p>
        <p><strong>Temporary Variables</strong> There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared. If avariable is only required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it’s still available later in the code. Even worse, the name of the variable may clash with another piece of code (an external JavaScript library, for example) resulting in errors. Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.</p>
        <p><strong>An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again. Because the code is only run once, there’s no need to create any reusable,named functions, and all the variables will also be temporary. An IIFE will beinvoked once, and can set up any variables, objects and event handlers when thepage loads</strong></p>
        <p>One of the problems with simply placing'use strict'at the beginning of a file is that it will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file, and if you’re using other people’s code, there’s no guarantee that they’vecoded in strict mode. To avoid this, the recommended way to use strict mode is to place all your codeinside an IIFE.</p>
        <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only callitself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning ananonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function. If the function is also assigned to another variable, this variable will maintain the original function definition and not be rewritten. This is because the original function is assigned to a variable, then within the function, a variable with the same name as the function is assigned to a different function.</p>
        <p>A <strong>recursive function</strong> is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’sa useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved.</p>
        <p><strong>Callbacks</strong> can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming.JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code will ever be processed at a time. This may seem like a limitation, but non-blocking techniques can be used to ensure that the program continues to run. Instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created that’s invoked when the event happens. This means that the code is able to run out of order, orasynchronously.</p>
        <p>A <strong>promise</strong> represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don’t do anything that can’t already be achieved using callbacks, but they help simplify the process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using multiple callbacks.</p>
        <p>A <strong>closure</strong> is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function,maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.</p>
        <p><strong>Generator</strong> ES6 introduced support for generators. These are special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value. Calling a generator function doesn’t actually run any of the code in the function; it returns a Generator object that can be used to create an iterator that implements a next() method that returns a value every time the next()method is called.</p>
        <h2>Ajax</h2>
        <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with aserver, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be  updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</p>
        <p>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.</p>
        <p>Consequently, a server is required when requesting resources using Ajax.Typically this involves using a server-side language, such as PHP, Ruby, Node.js,or .NET to serve the data response following an Ajax request (usually from aback-end database). To practice using Ajax, you can either set up a local development server on your own computer, or request the files from an external website that uses cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in order to avoid the same-origin policy that browsers enforce.</p>
        <p><strong>Asynchronous</strong> - when a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. It can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received. By using callbacks to manage this, programs are able to run in an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.</p>
        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> was always considered a front-end language, not used to communicate with the server. Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.</p>
        <p><strong>XML</strong> - when the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data. Many different types of data can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON, which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML.</p>
        <p><strong>Fetch API</strong> is a living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network. The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.</p>
        <p>The Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that’s returned when the promise is fulfilled. Response objects have a number of properties and methods that allow us to process the response effectively.</p>
        <p>There <strong>direct() method</strong> can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to the response from the redirected URL.</p>
        <p>The <strong>text() method</strong> takes a stream of text from the response, reads it tocompletion and then returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that canbe treated as a string in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The <strong>blob() method </strong>is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or aspreadsheet. Once it has read the whole file, it returns a promise that resolveswith ablobobject</p>
        <p><strong>JSON</strong> is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. Thejson()method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into apromise that resolves to a JavaScript object</p>
        <p>We can get more fine-grained control over the request being made by providing a <strong>Request object</strong> as an argument. This allows a number of options to be set about the request.Request objects are created using the Request() constructor</p>
        <p>The five most commonly used verbs when dealing with resources on the web are:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>GET requests to retrieve resources</li>
            <li>POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task</li>
            <li>PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely</li>
            <li>PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource</li>
            <li>DELETE requests to delete a resource</li>
            <li>By default, a link in a web page will make a GET request. Forms are also submitted using a GET request by default, but they will often use a POST request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>HTTP headers</strong> are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. Typical information contained in headers includes the file-type of the  resource, cookie information, authentication information and when the resource was last modified.The Fetch API introduced a Headers interface, which can be used to create a Headers object, which can then be added as a property of Request and Response objects</p>
        <p>The Fetch API includes the <strong>FormData interface,</strong> which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax. AFormData instance is created using a constructor function. If a form is passed to this constructor function as an argument, the form data instance will serialize all the data automatically, ready to be sent using Ajax.</p>
