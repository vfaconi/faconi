        <p>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate,rotate,scale,and/or skewany element on the page.We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions.Transforms don’t work on inline elements</p>
        <p><strong>Translation</strong> functions allow you to move elements left,right,up,or down.These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes.When you employ a translation function,you’removing elements without impacting the flow of the document.Unlike position: relative, which allows you to position an element either against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor,a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.</p>
        <p><strong>Scalling</strong> scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided,it will be used for both the x and y values,growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-elemen twhile maintaining the original aspect ratio.</p>
        <p><strong>Rotation</strong> - the rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.As with scale, by default the point of originis the element’s center.Generally, angles are declared in degrees with positive degrees moving clockwise and  negative moving counter clockwise.In addition to degrees,values can be providednin grads,radians,or turns,but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.</p>
        <p><strong>Skew</strong> - the skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.The x specifies the skew on thex axis,and they specifies the skew on they axis.</p>
        <p><strong>Transitions</strong> allow the values of CSS properties to change overtime,essentially providing simple animations.For example,if a link changes color on hover, you can have it gradually fade from one color to the other instead of a sudden change.They’re both transitions,but with the CSS transition property the color transition can be gradual.If the browser lacks support for transitions,the change will be immediate instead of gradual,which is fine and accessible</p>
        <p>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
            <li>Declare thefinal state of your transitioned element;for example,a:hover state.</li>
            <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties,including:transition-property,transition-duration,transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The <strong>transition-property</strong> property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned,with all for all properties being the default Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a valid midpoint can be transitioned.For example,in transitioning from a 1px red border to a 15px blue border, we transition the color and width of the border. The midpoint of 1px and 15px is obvious(8px),so we know that is a transition able property value.The midpoint between red and blue might not seem obvious,but the browser converts named colors to their numeric values,which have a midpoint.If the border-style we redeclared as changing from solid to dashed,that would not be a transition able property as there is no midpoint between these key terms.</p>
        <p>
            The <strong>transition-duration</strong> property sets how long the transition will take:the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.You can specify this either in seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms).
        </p>
        <p>The <strong>transition properties</strong> allow for multiple transitions in one call. For example,if we want to change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can.</p>
        <p>A <strong>keyframe</strong> is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition.With CSS transitions,we’re essentially limited to defining a first and a last keyframe.CSS animations allow us to add any number of keyframes in between,to guide our animation in more complex ways.</p>
        <p>With HTML5’s <strong>Canvas API</strong>, we can draw any thing we can imagine,all through JavaScript.This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off th enetwork.With canvas,we can draw shapes and lines,arcs and text,gradients and patterns.In addition,canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video. All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API. Once we’ve stored our canvas element in a variable,we then setup the canvas’s context. The context is the place where your drawing is rendered.Currently, there’s only wide support for drawing to a two-dimensional context.The W3C Canvas spec defines the context in the Canvas Rendering Context2D interface.Most methods we’ll be using to draw on to the canvas are defined in this interface. We could instead draw the image at the center of the canvas by changing the X and Y coordinates that we pass to draw Image.</p>
        <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML.A major selling point of vector graphics in generalis that,unlike bitmap images(such as GIF, JPEG, PNG,and TIFF),vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down.We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas,including drawing paths,shapes,text,gradients,and patterns.</p>
        <p>There are several steps to adding drag and drop to your page.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable.</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the drag start event on any draggable HTMLelements.</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the drag over and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept dropped items.</li>
        </ol>
